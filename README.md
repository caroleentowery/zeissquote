work - HTML / CSS / JavaScript

This is a webpage that I made for my work.  It allows the salesmen to fill out a series of questions and make a tiny text file that they copy / paste into Salesforce.

I had to teach myself JavaScript in order to make this page.  It was a really big deal for me and I was proud of learning it!
